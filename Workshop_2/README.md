#Workshop #2
This workshop is focused on developing the backend of a vehicle sales company. Among the job requirements we find:
- Each vehicle has at least engine, chasis (A or B), model, gas consumption, and year.
- Depending on the vehicle type, you should define additional properties.
- There are different vehicle types (for now): car, truck, yacht, and motorcycle.
- Each engine has at least a name, type of engine, potency, and weight.
- To calculate the vehicle gas consumption you could create a method based on:
1.1 ∗ engine.potency + 0.2 ∗ engine.weight - (0.3 if A or 0.5 if B)

In this folder are the documents Engine_company_class_diagram.png and the document Technical report.pdf
