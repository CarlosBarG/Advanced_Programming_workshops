# Public repository of Advanced Programming
### Name: Carlos Alberto Barriga Gamez 
This is a public repository that includes submissions of works done in the advanced programming class.
Currently there are folders Workshop_1,  Workshop_2, Workshop_3 adn Workshop_4.
Additionally, there are the documents of the deliveries made in class of the Workshop 2, at the root of the repository, since at first I couldn't put them in the folder.
